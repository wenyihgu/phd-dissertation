## 📘 Title  
**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Engagement Among Faculty: Impact on Promotion and/or Tenure**

---

## 📍 Abstract

This research investigates how faculty diversity contributions are perceived in promotion and tenure (P&T) processes, focusing on faculty of color. Using social categorization theory, the study analyzes 6,413 external review letters (ERLs) from 1,072 candidates across three universities to assess how diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) language relates to P&T outcomes.

A linear mixed-effects model and multiple regression were used to examine whether race moderates the impact of DEI language in ERLs. Results show that candidates of color—particularly Hispanic and Black faculty—received more DEI-focused language in their ERLs, but this language was associated with **more negative P&T outcomes** compared to their White counterparts. These findings highlight how DEI efforts may unintentionally lead to evaluative backlash and underscore the need for institutional reforms in how ERLs are interpreted.
